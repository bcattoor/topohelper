Building it yourself
--------------------
Building the documentation: requirements on Windows:

- `PERL <http://strawberryperl.com>`_
- `MiKTex <https://miktex.org/download>`_
- `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_
- `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html#windows>`_
  -> ``C:\> pip install -U sphinx``

Install all of the above, and make sure you log off your user account. That way the environment variables (ea.: PATH) get reread from the registry.
